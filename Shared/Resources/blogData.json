        "detail": "It's time to focus on the science, and fight the stigma.\n \n üß†RETHINK ADDICTION\n -It's not about willpower-\n Opioid addiction is a Substance Use Disorder. It is not a moral weakness; it is a chronic disease called Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). It changes and rewires the brain, making it hard for people to quit, even when addiction is destroying their lives. Even when they try again and again.\n \n üïôRETHINK RECOVERY\n -It's about potential for long-term change-\n Because OUD is a chronic medical disease, it's a long-term process to help the brain recover. It takes time without using illicit opioids to stop craving them, and be satisfied with natural levels of dopamine again.\n \n üè•RETHINK TREATMENT\n -It's about science-\n Although no single pathway to recovery is right for everyone, research has shown people seeking recovery from opioid problems are more successful when they combine a prescribed medication used to treat addiction with professional counseling and a strong support system.",
